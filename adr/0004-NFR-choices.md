## Decision

Figma will be the primary prototyping tool utilized for the project, as it provides an efficient and user-friendly environment for designing and visualizing interface concepts.

## Consequences

* **Interactive Prototyping:**  Figma's capabilities for creating interactive prototypes support a more dynamic representation of the user interface, allowing for better visualization of the deliverables set out by the project.
* **Learning Curve:**  Given my lack of prior experience with Figma, an extended learning phase is required to produce high-quality prototypes.
* **Version Control and History:** As Figma offers version control and iteration tracking, it allows for previous designs to be revisited and iterated if necessary.
