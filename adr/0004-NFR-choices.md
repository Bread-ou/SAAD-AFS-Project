# 1. Using Figma as the prototyping tool

Date: 01-11-2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For prototyping and design purposes in the ongoing project, various tools are available to support the creation and visualization of interface designs. Some options include:
* **Protopie:** A tool specializing in the creation of high-fidelity interactions and animations for mobile and web interfaces.
* **Figma:** A cloud-based design tool that allows collaborative prototyping, wireframing, and interface design. 
* **Adobe XD:** is a vector design tool for web and mobile applications with an extensive feature set, which allows for designing and prototyping user interfaces. 

## Decision

Figma will be the primary prototyping tool utilized for the project, as it provides an efficient and user-friendly environment for designing and visualizing interface concepts.

## Consequences

* **Interactive Prototyping:**  Figma's capabilities for creating interactive prototypes support a more dynamic representation of the user interface, allowing for better visualization of the deliverables set out by the project.
* **Learning Curve:**  Given my lack of prior experience with Figma, an extended learning phase is required to produce high-quality prototypes.
* **Version Control and History:** As Figma offers version control and iteration tracking, it allows for previous designs to be revisited and iterated if necessary.
