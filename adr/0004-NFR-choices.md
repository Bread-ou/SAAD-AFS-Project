# 4. Choosing Which Non-Functional Requirments (NFRs) to Pursue 

Date: 02-12-2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In developing a software application, numerous non-functional requirements (NFRs) can be considered. However, meeting these NFRs demands significant resources, and sometimes, certain NFRs may conflict with each other. Therefore, it is best to prioritize a select few NFRs, which helps provide a clear focus on what is most integral to the software's overall goal.

**NFRs include but are not limited to:**
* Performance
* Capacity
* Availability
* Security
* Manageability
* Usability
* Accessibility
* Scalability
* Compliance
* Usability

## Decision

Given that the application is designed to cater to a vast number of users globally, the key non-functional requirements (NFRs) to prioritize are:

* Security
* Compliance
* Internationalization
* Scalability
* Availability
* 
The emphasis here leans towards expanding reach, ensuring broad applicability, and scalability, rather than concentrating on performance or catering to a specialized user base.

## Consequences

* **Interactive Prototyping:**  Figma's capabilities for creating interactive prototypes support a more dynamic representation of the user interface, allowing for better visualization of the deliverables set out by the project.
* **Learning Curve:**  Given my lack of prior experience with Figma, an extended learning phase is required to produce high-quality prototypes.
* **Version Control and History:** As Figma offers version control and iteration tracking, it allows for previous designs to be revisited and iterated if necessary.
