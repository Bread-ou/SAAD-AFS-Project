## Context

Selecting the right technology stack or framework is crucial in software development, as it shapes problem-solving approaches and impacts the system's capabilities. 
Each technology stack has unique strengths and weaknesses, making it vital to assess and choose the one that aligns best with our project's requirements. 
Potential options include but not limited to:

* **Node.js**: Ideal for the backend due to its efficient handling of asynchronous operations and JavaScript compatibility.
* **React:** A robust library for building dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces.0
* **Angular:** Offers a comprehensive solution for building scalable web applications.
* **Vue.js:** Known for its simplicity and ease of integration, suitable for more straightforward projects.
* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development.

## Decision


Node.js is an ideal backend for a system implementing SOA due to its proficiency in building scalable network applications. 
It supports the creation and communication of modular components, crucial for SOA's distributed nature. 
Complementing Node.js, React is an excellent front-end technology choice. Its popularity, along with a rich library ecosystem, makes it adept at constructing dynamic user interfaces, 
which will seamlessly integrate with the Node.js backend, ensuring a robust and responsive application.

## Consequences

Choosing the aformentioned technologies will enable efficient backend and front end operation. Both technologies have extensive libraries and large communites, which can accelarate and improve development.
React is also backed by Meta (formerly Facebook), allowing for a degree of future secuirty. However, this decision will lead to added complexity, as one most be familier with the 
nuances of both technologies to make proper use of them.
