# 10. Choosing a Website Theme Accomadting for People with Colour Blindness 

Date: 20-12-2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When creating a website, factoring in the needs of all users, including those with accessibility requirements,
is crucial. Colour blindness, impacting about 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women (About Colour Blindness, 2022), significantly impacts how users interact with online platforms.
Intending to cater to a wide audience, the AFS solution will adhere to a colour palette  that accommodates colour blindness.
This approach will greatly elevate the solution's accessibility and reach.

## Decision

Following the guidance set by Shaffer in their tableau blog on designing colour-blind-friendly visualizations,
the solution will adopt a palette combining dark blue and light grey, with orange as an accent colour.
This choice of colours will make the website more accessible to individuals with protanopia and deuteranopia. 
In cases of people with tritanopia, the contrast of the colours and the orange 
accent should help with distinguishing between the different artefacts.

## Consequences

* **Inclusivity:** The choice of a colour-blind friendly palette allows the application to be more accessible to a broader range of audience, including those with colour vision deficiencies.
*  **User Satisfaction:** For those with colour blindness, the website will be easier to use and understand, leading to a more satisfying user experience.
*  **Design Limitations:** The colour palette will restrict some of the design elements used in the application, and great care needs to be taken when adding images and artefacts that might conflict with the theme.
